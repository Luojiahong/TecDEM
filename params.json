  "body": "TecDEM: Tectonics from Digital Elevation Models\r\n================================================\r\nDuring the last years the Remote Sensing Group at TU Bergakademie Freiberg has developed a series of algorithms based on digital elevation information. The main contribution of the group is the development of TecDEM, a MATLAB-based software, allowing the analysis of tectonic geomorphology from digital elevation models. The aim of this tool is to analyse the extracted drainage network and to generate morphometric maps for surface dynamics and basin analyses.\r\n\r\nThe graphical user interface of TecDEM provides several options: determining flow directions, stream vectorization, watershed delineation, strahler order labeling, stream profile generation, knickpoints selection, Concavity, Steepness and Hack indices calculations. The knickpoints along selected streams as well as stream profile analysis, and Hack index per stream profile are computed using a semi automatic method. TecDEM includes a suite of algorithms to analyze topography, extracted drainage networks and sub-basins. TecDEM also allows the extraction of parameters such as isobase, incision, drainage density and surface roughness maps. We also provide tools for basin asymmetry and hypsometric analysis. These are efficient graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for mapping drainage deviation from basin mid-line and basin hypsometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease refer to a short user guide for the use of this software. If you have any questions or remarks, please contact the author by dropping an email on tecdem at icloud.com\r\n",
